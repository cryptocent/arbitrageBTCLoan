ðŸš€ Arbitrage Bot - Production Guidelines
Deploying a flashloan-based arbitrage bot requires careful attention to security, reliability, and risk management. This document outlines the most important best practices you should follow when operating in production.

âœ… 1. Use a Private or Dedicated RPC
Never use public RPCs (Infura free-tier, Alchemy free-tier, etc.) for production.
Public RPCs are slow, unreliable, and expose your bot's actions.

Recommended:
 Alchemy Premium
 Infura Premium
 QuickNode
 Self-hosted full or archive node
 Update your .env:
 ```env
 RPC=https://your-private-rpc
```
âœ… 2. Flashbots Protect (Mandatory)
Never send profitable transactions to the public mempool.
Use Flashbots Protect or another private relay.
Prevent frontrunning and sandwich attacks.

âœ… 3. Slack or Discord Alerts Enabled
Configure WEBHOOK_URL in your .env.

Alerts should notify you when:
 A profitable opportunity is detected.
 A flashloan is executed.
 Any failure happens (Flashbots rejection, revert, etc.).
 Use the included alerts.js to integrate notifications easily.

âœ… 4. Wallet Isolation (Hot vs. Cold Wallets)
Do not use your main trading wallet's private key.
Use a dedicated private key specifically for the bot.
Limit token approvals (allowance) to the bot only.

âœ… 5. Gas Strategy (Dynamic)
Included gasBiddingStrategy.js automatically adapts to baseFee.
Recommended tweaks:
 Adjust priority fees during volatile periods.
 Adjust slippage buffer (SLIPPAGE_BPS in .env) based on liquidity and route length.

âœ… 6. Log Rotation & Retention
Docker:
  Included docker-compose.override.yml handles log rotation.
PM2:
  Use PM2's built-in log rotation:
```bash
   pm2 install pm2-logrotate
```

âœ… 7. PM2 Cluster Mode (Optional for Non-Docker)
For bots like cross-chain scanners or alert daemons:
  ```bash
   pm2 start ecosystem.config.js -i max
```
This will utilize all available CPU cores for auxiliary bots.

âœ… 8. Grafana + Prometheus Monitoring
Already integrated via docker-compose.yml.

Grafana default access:
 URL:      http://localhost:3000
 User:     admin
 Password: admin

Set custom Grafana alerts for:
 Arbitrage Success Rate
 Flashloan Failures
 Bot Restarts
 Profits per execution


âœ… 9. Fork Testing (Mandatory)
Before deployment:
  ```bash
   npx hardhat test
 ```  
Test for:
 Flashloan routing correctness
 Slippage impact
 Gas cost estimation
 Strategy profitability
 Bundle acceptance on Flashbots

âœ… 10. Version Control & Backup
  Always use Git to track:
Strategy changes
 Gas strategy modifications
 Contract deployment addresses
Backup your environment:
 .env file (sensitive)
 Private keys (offline)
 Deployment notes

âœ… 11. Optional: Profit Tracker
For a simple Prometheus-based profit tracker:
 Export profit metrics directly inside searcherBot.js
 Create a Prometheus collector endpoint in your bot
Display:
 Total profits
 Flashloan counts
 Average profit per transaction
 Visualize in Grafana

âœ… 12. Optional: Risk Management Checklist
Before production:
 Use private RPC endpoint
 Run Flashbots-only transactions
 Fork-test all strategies
 Enable Slack/Discord alerts
 Use a dedicated private key
 Setup monitoring
 Adjust slippage according to route volatility
 Enable log rotation
 Limit allowances to bot's contracts only
 Document & version control all changes

Operator Advice:
If you aren't sure about a deployment â€” assume it's not ready.
Losses happen mostly due to poor pre-flight checks, not bad arbitrage logic.



DOCKER INSTALL

Prerequisites:
 Installed Docker
 Installed Docker Compose
 Git Installed

âœ… Step 1 â€” Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cryptocent/arbitrageBTCLoan.git
cd arbitrageBTCLoan
```
âœ… Step 2 â€” Create Environment File
Copy the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Then open .env in a text editor and configure:
Your Private Key
RPC endpoints
Engine address
Token addresses
Adapter addresses
Webhook URL (optional)

Example:

```ini
PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key
RPC=https://your-mainnet-rpc
ENGINE_ADDRESS=0xYourArbitrageEngine
UNISWAP_ADAPTER=0xYourUniswapAdapter
BALANCER_ADAPTER=0xYourBalancerAdapter
CURVE_ADAPTER=0xYourCurveAdapter
UNISWAP_QUOTER=0xYourUniswapQuoter
CURVE_POOL=0xYourCurvePool
WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-discord-or-slack-webhook
FLASHLOAN_AMOUNT=1000
SLIPPAGE_BPS=50
```


âœ… Step 3 â€” Verify Docker is Working
```bash
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```
âœ… Step 4 â€” Build Docker Image

docker-compose build
If you get a yarn.lock error:

```bash
yarn install
```
If you donâ€™t have yarn:

```bash
npm install -g yarn
yarn install
```
Then rebuild:

```bash
docker-compose build
```
âœ… Step 5 â€” Start the Stack
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
âœ… Step 6 â€” Confirm Everything is Running
```bash
docker-compose ps
```
You should see:

```mathematica
searcher     Up
prometheus   Up
grafana      Up
```
âœ… Step 7 â€” Access Monitoring Dashboard
Service	URL
 Grafana	http://localhost:3000 (default login: admin / admin)
 Prometheus	http://localhost:9090
âœ… Step 8 â€” Logs (Optional)
```bash
docker-compose logs -f searcher
```
âœ… Step 9 â€” Stopping the Bot
```bash
docker-compose down
```
âœ… Notes
Profitable arbitrage will trigger Slack/Discord alerts if webhook configured.
Monitoring stack (Grafana + Prometheus) is included.
Docker Compose will relaunch the stack after a system reboot if you enable:

```yaml
restart: always
```
in your docker-compose.yml.
