ðŸš€ Arbitrage Bot - Production Guidelines
Deploying a flashloan-based arbitrage bot requires careful attention to security, reliability, and risk management. This document outlines the most important best practices you should follow when operating in production.

âœ… 1. Use a Private or Dedicated RPC
Never use public RPCs (Infura free-tier, Alchemy free-tier, etc.) for production.

Public RPCs are slow, unreliable, and expose your bot's actions.

Recommended:

Alchemy Premium

Infura Premium

QuickNode

Self-hosted full or archive node

Update your .env:

env
Copy
Edit
RPC=https://your-private-rpc
âœ… 2. Flashbots Protect (Mandatory)
Never send profitable transactions to the public mempool.

Use Flashbots Protect or another private relay.

Prevent frontrunning and sandwich attacks.

âœ… 3. Slack or Discord Alerts Enabled
Configure WEBHOOK_URL in your .env.

Alerts should notify you when:

A profitable opportunity is detected.

A flashloan is executed.

Any failure happens (Flashbots rejection, revert, etc.).

Use the included alerts.js to integrate notifications easily.

âœ… 4. Wallet Isolation (Hot vs. Cold Wallets)
Do not use your main trading wallet's private key.

Use a dedicated private key specifically for the bot.

Limit token approvals (allowance) to the bot only.

âœ… 5. Gas Strategy (Dynamic)
Included gasBiddingStrategy.js automatically adapts to baseFee.

Recommended tweaks:

Adjust priority fees during volatile periods.

Adjust slippage buffer (SLIPPAGE_BPS in .env) based on liquidity and route length.

âœ… 6. Log Rotation & Retention
Docker:

Included docker-compose.override.yml handles log rotation.

PM2:

Use PM2's built-in log rotation:

bash
Copy
Edit
pm2 install pm2-logrotate
âœ… 7. PM2 Cluster Mode (Optional for Non-Docker)
For bots like cross-chain scanners or alert daemons:

bash
Copy
Edit
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js -i max
This will utilize all available CPU cores for auxiliary bots.

âœ… 8. Grafana + Prometheus Monitoring
Already integrated via docker-compose.yml.

Grafana default access:

URL: http://localhost:3000

User: admin

Password: admin

Set custom Grafana alerts for:

Arbitrage Success Rate

Flashloan Failures

Bot Restarts

Profits per execution

âœ… 9. Fork Testing (Mandatory)
Before deployment:

bash
Copy
Edit
npx hardhat test
Test for:

Flashloan routing correctness

Slippage impact

Gas cost estimation

Strategy profitability

Bundle acceptance on Flashbots

âœ… 10. Version Control & Backup
Always use Git to track:

Strategy changes

Gas strategy modifications

Contract deployment addresses

Backup your environment:

.env file (sensitive)

Private keys (offline)

Deployment notes

âœ… 11. Optional: Profit Tracker
For a simple Prometheus-based profit tracker:

Export profit metrics directly inside searcherBot.js

Create a Prometheus collector endpoint in your bot

Display:

Total profits

Flashloan counts

Average profit per transaction

Visualize in Grafana

âœ… 12. Optional: Risk Management Checklist
Before production:

 Use private RPC endpoint

 Run Flashbots-only transactions

 Fork-test all strategies

 Enable Slack/Discord alerts

 Use a dedicated private key

 Setup monitoring

 Adjust slippage according to route volatility

 Enable log rotation

 Limit allowances to bot's contracts only

 Document & version control all changes

Operator Advice:
If you aren't sure about a deployment â€” assume it's not ready.
Losses happen mostly due to poor pre-flight checks, not bad arbitrage logic.
